Each version introduced new features, enhancements, and improvements to the Java language, libraries, and platform.


************************************** JDK 8 features *******************************************

> Lambda Expressions: Lambda expressions allow the concise representation of anonymous functions, enabling functional programming style in Java.
They simplify the syntax for writing code by reducing boilerplate code when working with collections, event handling, and functional interfaces.

> Stream API: The Stream API provides a fluent and functional approach for processing collections of data in Java.

> Default Methods in Interfaces: JDK 8 introduced the concept of default methods in interfaces, allowing interfaces to have method implementations.

> Functional Interfaces: Functional interfaces are interfaces with a single abstract method, also known as SAM (Single Abstract Method) interfaces.
JDK 8 introduced the @FunctionalInterface annotation to denote such interfaces, making them easier to identify and use with lambda expressions.

> Date and Time API (java.time): JDK 8 introduced a new Date and Time API to address the shortcomings of the existing java.util.Date and
java.util.Calendar classes. The java.time package provides classes such as LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime, Duration,
and Period for working with dates, times, and intervals.

> Optional Class: The Optional class is a container object that may or may not contain a non-null value. It helps to prevent NullPointerExceptions
by encouraging developers to handle null values explicitly.

************************************** JDK 9 features *******************************************

> JShell: The Java Shell: JShell is a new tool introduced in JDK 9 that provides an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment for evaluating
Java code snippets and expressions. It allows developers to quickly test and experiment with Java code without needing to create a complete Java program.
JShell makes it easier to learn Java, prototype algorithms, and debug code interactively.

************************************** JDK 10 features *******************************************

> Local Variable Type Inference (var): JDK 10 introduced the var keyword for local variable type inference. This feature allows the type of local
variables to be inferred automatically by the compiler, based on the initializer expression. It reduces boilerplate code and improves code readability,
especially when dealing with complex generic types.
